 Notes:
 If you're looking for something that easy to start with I recommend mo.js and pop motion. They are spectacular.
 Framer and react spring looks the same.
 Lottie Js by Airbnb is a magical library, if you've clicked like button on Twitter then that animation is Lottie Js. Highly recommended.
 All of them have support for React, good documentation, examples and blogs.
